"""
Block-level optimization round over the scalarized flow block.

The passes in `optimizations_rewrite` are keyed to `ir.tstore[...].cfg`, so none
of them reach `ir.flow_block`. Wrapping the block in a one-node CFG lets the
existing cfg-level passes run on it directly -- valid only while the block is
pure SSA, which it is exactly when sroa reports no view writes, since those are
the only mutations it ever emits.
